# Tic-Tac-Toe-With-Numbers
## A board of 3 x 3 is displayed and players take turns selecting numbers from the list of 1 to 9. Once a number is chosen, it cannot be chosen again.
## If a player picks three numbers that sum up to 15, they win. If all numbers are used and no player achieves a sum of exactly 15, the game ends in a draw.
